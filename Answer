#First I started off with importing the dataset into SQLightStudio
#Creating a table with "socialdata"

#I didn't include a primary key or constraint because of duplicating data and I need to keep them.

CREATE TABLE socialdata (
Published_Date TEXT,
Account TEXT, 
Account_Type TEXT, 
Campaign_Name TEXT,
Total_impressions INTEGER,
Total_Engagements INTEGER,
Media_Type TEXT )

#1. What is the typical engagement rate we can expect? Whatâ€™s the likelihood that we can
achieve a 15% engagement rate?

##To find engagement rate: 
SELECT Account_Type, AVG(Total_Engagements) / AVG(Total_Impressions) AS average_engagement_rate
FROM socialdata
GROUP BY Account_Type;

##What is the likelihood to achieve a 15% engagement rate? 
FBPAGE	0.17807349168267
INSTAGRAM	0.02352703187049
LINKEDIN_COMPANY	0.01983598514053
TIKTOK_BUSINESS	0.05481478037767
TWITTER	0.03100207809033
YOUTUBE	0.04332160249661
## Out of all social media platform, Facebook is most likely to achieve a 15% engagement rate.


#2. Does day of the week and time of posting affect engagement rates?
##First I use this code to follow format of "MM-DD-YYYY HH:MM" To find DayofWeek and HourofDay
SELECT 
  CAST(strftime('%w', datetime(substr(Published_Date, 7, 4) || '-' || substr(Published_Date, 1, 2) || '-' || substr(Published_Date, 4, 2) || ' ' || substr(Published_Date, 12), 'localtime')) AS INTEGER) AS DayOfWeek,
  CAST(strftime('%H', datetime(substr(Published_Date, 7, 4) || '-' || substr(Published_Date, 1, 2) || '-' || substr(Published_Date, 4, 2) || ' ' || substr(Published_Date, 12), 'localtime')) AS INTEGER) AS HourOfDay,
  *
FROM socialdata;

## Then to find the day of the week and time that has the most engagement rate would be 
SELECT 
  DayOfWeek,
  HourOfDay,
  AVG(Total_Engagements) / AVG(Total_Impressions) AS Average_Engagement_Rate
FROM (
  SELECT 
    CAST(strftime('%w', datetime(substr(Published_Date, 7, 4) || '-' || substr(Published_Date, 1, 2) || '-' || substr(Published_Date, 4, 2) || ' ' || substr(Published_Date, 12), 'localtime')) AS INTEGER) AS DayOfWeek,
    CAST(strftime('%H', datetime(substr(Published_Date, 7, 4) || '-' || substr(Published_Date, 1, 2) || '-' || substr(Published_Date, 4, 2) || ' ' || substr(Published_Date, 12), 'localtime')) AS INTEGER) AS HourOfDay,
    Total_Engagements,
    Total_Impressions
  FROM socialdata
) ;

## Answer: 5(friday) at hour of the day : 15


#3. How are our game titles doing in terms of social performance? Is there a specific game
we should focus more on or less?

## Finding total impressions and total engagement
SELECT
  Account,
  SUM(Total_Impressions) AS Total_Impressions,
  SUM(Total_Engagements) AS Total_Engagements
FROM
  socialdata
WHERE
  Account IN ('GeneraL', 'CSGO', 'DOTA2', 'Valorant', 'Content Creators')
GROUP BY
  Account;

##Answer
##CSGO has highest Impressions and DOTA2 has highest Engagements 
##Focusing on CSGO that has highest impressions to improve engagements can help out greatly. 
##OR focusing on Valorant who has the lowest engagement and impressions can help out the brand greatly in the Valorant community. 


#4. What media type performs the best?

SELECT Media_Type, AVG(Total_Engagements) AS AverageEngagements
FROM socialdata
GROUP BY Media_Type
ORDER BY AverageEngagements DESC ; 
##Answer: Mixed seem like the best media type, however, second best would be Photo


#5. What is our best performing campaign?
SELECT Campaign_Name, AVG(Total_Engagements) AS AverageEngagements
FROM socialdata
GROUP BY Campaign_Name
ORDER BY AverageEngagements DESC ; 

#Answer: Community Engagement

#6. Define out a posting strategy for our social channels based on your discoveries.
## Focusing on scheduling the company or game's post on Friday, in the afternoon, around 15:00 to leverage peak engagement time.
## Since CSGO and DOTA2 has highest Engagement and Impression, posting CSGO and DOTA2 related content into the posting strategy. For example, updates, highlists, tournaments, and etc. Additionally, posting gifs and memes on your story can capitalize engagement rates.
## Lastly, with campaign focus, the company can focus on giving back to the community with giveaways, poll, and interacting Q&A to enhance community involvement and interaction. 


#7. What suggestions would you give to the social media team if they want to expand their
presence (e.g. if our CSGO youtube channel is doing well should we expand to TikTok)?
## Staying up to date with latest trends and algorithms. For example, following the latest trend. Example: right now on tiktok, Repo Reaper is really popular. Try to incorporate the trend with our posting. 
## Being Consistent and posting Regularly so the specific social media crowd doesn't decrease. Additionally, engaging with audience helps. 
## Cross Promotion between platforms. For example, since CSGO and DOTA has the highest engagement and impressions, using existing channels that is successful to promote other platforms. For example, if CSGO is popular on Youtube, posting on live and inviting audience to look at TikTok page of CSGO can help with expansion efforts. (Mentioning the other platform in a successful platform)
